# MoroccoJUG Adopt JSR program

MoroccoJUG's team was a member of the adoptJSR program since it first edition, where we won the "outstanding adopt a JSR participant" prize. Thereby we wanted to get the most of MoroccoJUG's community involved in this program as a part of our 2015 road-map. 

In this document we're putting together a getting started guide that will help you  get up to speed quickly:

  - List of adopted JSRs
  - How to contribute
  - Code source of the Pet Store application 

## List of adopted JSRs
 - JSR-365 : CDI 2.0
 - JSR-367 : JSON-P
 - JSR-369 : Servlet 4.0
 - JSR-370 : JAX-RS 2.1
 - JSR-371 : MVC 1.0
 - JSR-372 : JSF 2.3 

## How to contribute
The glassfish page for adopt a JSR explain it will on how to get involved:

-Share ideas and feedback, possibly by entering issues in public issue trackers (almost every JSR has one).
-When using email, use "Adopt-a-JSR" in the subject line for greater visibility.
-For JIRA, use the "adoptajsr" tag for greater visibility (all Oracle led specifications use JIRA).
-Follow expert group discussions and chime in if needed.
-Read early versions of specifications and Javadocs.
-Try writing applications using early builds of the reference implementation (likely GlassFish in case of Java EE).
-Write or speak about the technology.
-Encourage others to participate.

At the time of writing this article there is no nightly builds available for Glassfish 5 (wich will be Java EE 8 compliant), thus contributions to the program will focus on reviewing the specs, giving feedback and if possible testing early builds of implementations.

Let's take for exemple CDI 2.0, although the alpha version if available the specs are not yet final. Taking this into consideration MoroccoJUG will concentrate on discussing, reviewing and giving feedback on the changes to the upcoming CDI 2.0 (JSR-365) through tow main channels: The existing mailing list (https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/cdi-dev) and IRC channel (#cdi-spec on freenode).
