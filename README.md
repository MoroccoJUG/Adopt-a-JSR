# MoroccoJUG Adopt JSR program

MoroccoJUG's team was a member of the adoptJSR program since the first edition, where we won the "outstanding adopt a JSR participant" prize. Thereby we wanted to strengthen MoroccoJUG's community involvement in this program as a part of our 2015 road-map. 

In this document we're putting together a getting started guide that will help you  get up to speed quickly:

## List of adopted JSRs
 - JSR-365 : CDI 2.0
 - JSR-367 : JSON-P
 - JSR-369 : Servlet 4.0
 - JSR-370 : JAX-RS 2.1
 - JSR-371 : MVC 1.0
 - JSR-372 : JSF 2.3 

## How to contribute ?
The glassfish page ([https://glassfish.java.net/adoptajsr] ) for adopt a JSR sum it well:

 - Share ideas and feedback, possibly by entering issues in public issue trackers (almost every JSR has one).
 - When using email, use "Adopt-a-JSR" in the subject line for greater visibility.
 - For JIRA, use the "adoptajsr" tag for greater visibility (all Oracle led specifications use JIRA).
 - Follow expert group discussions and chime in if needed.
 - Read early versions of specifications and Javadocs.
 - Try writing applications using early builds of the reference implementation (likely GlassFish in case of Java EE).
 - Write or speak about the technology.
 - Encourage others to participate.

A detailed guide is also available at the Adopt a JSR Program's site ([https://java.net/projects/adoptajsr/pages/Home#Getting_Started]) make sure you take a look there.

At the time of writing this article there is no nightly builds available for Glassfish 5 (wich will be Java EE 8 compliant), thus contributions to the program will focus on reviewing the specs, giving feedback and if possible testing early builds of implementations.
 
Let's take for exemple CDI 2.0, although the alpha version if available the specs are not yet final. Taking this into consideration MoroccoJUG will concentrate on discussing, reviewing and giving feedback on the changes to the upcoming CDI 2.0 (JSR-365) through tow main channels: The existing mailing list (https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/cdi-dev) and IRC channel (#cdi-spec on freenode), you'll find the some interesting ongoing discussions like:
 - CDI support for Singleton Pseudo Scope
 - CDI and its relationship with Session beans
 - Enhancing SPI to support async operation for contexts
 To cite but a few.

Back to the main reason we're writing this artice: what can you do right now ? 

TL;DR;
 1. Join the mailing lists of the JSRs you're willing to work on
 2. Join the on going discussions and give you feedback when ever you have it 
 3. Play with the early build of the implementations
 4. Watch this github repository, more content will be availble.
 5. Install and run the demo Petstore application available on the repository and explore the code 
 
Morocco JUG leading team will be doing this:
 1. We'll be also watching the mailing lists 
 2. We will take the most interessting topics from the mailing list and create blog posts/ articles to share them with you
 3. At our mounthly meetings we will take 15 to 30 min ( or more if needed ) to introduce you the content of those blog posts and gather live feedback.
