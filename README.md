# MoroccoJUG Adopt JSR program

MoroccoJUG's team was a member of the adoptJSR program since it first edition, where we won the "outstanding adopt a JSR participant" prize. Thereby we wanted to get the most of MoroccoJUG's community involved in this program as a part of our 2015 road-map. 

In this document we're putting together a getting started guide that will help you  get up to speed quickly:

  - List of adopted JSRs
  - How to contribute
